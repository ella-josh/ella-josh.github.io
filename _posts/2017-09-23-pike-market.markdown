This has to be the longest day of 2017. Got up at 6am and didnt get back til 4am or something... But such fun times with Edward and Louis! I'm pretty sure we walked like 10 miles that day all because Edward said it was a "short walk to the space needle". Five miles later... LOL

>It's just a short walk to the space needle. <cite>- Edward</cite>


Aside from that it was a fun day. Everything from seeing ewer find his first true love in his clam chowder to Louis just walking in for free to the museum of pop and me losing my memory for the night lol. Edward just kept giving me shots of whiskey and I was fine until I stood up and I immediately knew I had too much lol. Then next thing I know I am wrestling Edward trying to just sleep but you wanted me to shower haha. I really just wanted to nap and shower in the morning. You should've just let me :P. I ended up just sleeping a bit in the shower I'm pretty sure.

Thank you for everything! And thank you for a great year together. I love you babe. Happy Anniversary!

Love,
Josh
