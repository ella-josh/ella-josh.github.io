Fun times with fun people. It was fun seeing everyone try to figure out the escape room and that one was much more fun than the first one we did for my birthday lol. The funniest thing I remember was when Morgan figured out the code for Dante and everyone went crazy. I'm amazed we were able to solve everything within 50 minutes only using two hints. It was fun spending that time with you figuring out the cables to spell out the numbers :) We should do more in the future.

>DANTE <cite>- Morgan</cite>

Oh and also! How can I forget about the Irish pub. That place was so good but so greasy, made me just want to sleep right away. But we had to push through and do the escape room and then white elephant later where Hons and Morgan were fighting over the google home mini lol. 

Thanks for always hosting our friends at your place, its always fun and festive :) (You should do more of them :P I'll help clean and set up).
