This was one of my most favorite days in 2017. It was so nice to spend the day with you going on a road trip all the way to VANCOUVER! The suspension bridge was so beautiful and I wouldn't have wanted to spend it with anyone else but you. I'm so glad you were able to come over and visit that weekend.

I really enjoyed all the food especially the Bao place we ate at, that was pretty good. And also just walking down Granville Island, was a nice cosy touristy spot. We also met that half wolf doggo over there that was so cute and so energetic, Kali would have been good friends with him. 

Getting lost with you is so fun and also amusing. Especially when I get stressed lol. Like when we were driving to Washington University... Yeah... lol. Anyways I'm so glad we were able to have this opportunity and I hope we will have more adventures in the future!
